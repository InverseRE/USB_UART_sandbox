Category:           STM32F4 Boards (Arduino_STM32)
Board:              Blackpill STM32F401CCU6
USB Configuration:  USB serial (CDC)
Optimize:

Throughput testing (using two shells):
> grep -m 1 "END" /dev/ttyACM0; date
> date; cat ./misc/dummy > /dev/ttyACM0
two-way rate = 131076 / ( time mark 1 - time mark 2 )

UART  38400:  11 kBps
UART 115200:  31 kBps
UART 250000:  70 kBps
UART 400000: 116 kBps



The idea follows:

In this example, link forms a contiguous line:
USB  ---a-->  CPU  ---b-->  UART  ---c-->  CPU  ---d-->  USB

With the following implications:
 * payload is constant at any stage (data not added, nor taken away)
 * 'a' waits when any of 'b' 'c' 'd' is busy
 * 'b' waits when 'c' of 'd' is busy
 * 'c' cannot wait, otherwise overrun occurs (data loss)
 * 'd' could wait if remote is busy
